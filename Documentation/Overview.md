# Angular Application (Front End) <br/>
## Setting Up

Open up Git Bash and clone the front end application into your desired folder: <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/revaturexyz/housing.git`

Make sure you are in the housing folder and make sure you are on your feature branch: <br/>
`cd housing/housing`

This will install all necessary dependencies specified in the package.json.
You will need these in order to sufficiently run the application: <br/>
`npm install`

Go into your source folder and you should now be able to run the application <br/>
```
cd housing/housing/src
ng serve --open
```

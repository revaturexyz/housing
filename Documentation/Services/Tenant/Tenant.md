## Summary
This Tenant service is used to get tenants by guid id, add new tenants, as well as edit existing tenants. These methods are from the tenant API

## Componets
 - Tenant-Profile: [Tenant-Profile]
 - Tenant-Maintenance: [Tenant-Maintenance]
 - View-Tenant Room: [View-Room]

## Issues
Teant-searcher and Tenant service should be the same file since they deal with CRUD tenant operations

[Tenant-Profile]: ../../Components/Tenant-profile.md
[Tenant-Maintenance]: ../../Components/Tenant-maintenance.md
[View-Room]: ../../Components/View-room.md
